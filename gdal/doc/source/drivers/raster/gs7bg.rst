GS7BG -- Golden Software Surfer 7 Binary Grid File Format
---------------------------------------------------------

This is the binary (non-human-readable) version of one of the raster
formats used by Golden Software products (such as the Surfer series).
This format differs from the `GSBG <#GSBG>`__ format (also known as
Surfer 6 binary grid format), it is more complicated and flexible.

NOTE: Implemented as ``gdal/frmts/gsg/gs7bgdataset.cpp``.
