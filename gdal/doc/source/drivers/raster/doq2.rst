DOQ2 -- New Labelled USGS DOQ
-----------------------------

Support for read access, including reading of an affine georeferencing
transform, capture of the projection string and reading of other
auxiliary fields as metadata. This format is the new, labelled DOQ
(Digital Ortho Quad) format from the USGS.

This driver was implemented by Derrick J Brashear.

NOTE: Implemented as ``gdal/frmts/raw/doq2dataset.cpp``.
